# DATAANALYSIS
Supermarket Sales Data Analysis:

This project analyzes supermarket sales data using Python to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights through visualizations.

Project Overview:

The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize sales data to identify key trends, such as top-performing cities, product categories, and temporal sales patterns, to support business decision-making.

Steps:

1.Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, converted the Date column to datetime, and dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., Invoice ID).

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculated total sales by city, gender, customer type, and product line; analyzed monthly and daily sales trends.

3.Data Visualization: Created bar, line, scatter, and pie charts to visualize sales patterns.

4.Documentation: Organized code, data, and visualizations in a GitHub repository with a professional report.

Tools Used:

-Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

-Dataset: supermarket_sales.csv

Outputs:

-Bar Chart (City Sales): Compares total sales across cities (Yangon, Mandalay, Naypyitaw).

-Bar Chart (Gender Sales): Compares total sales across Gender (Female, Male).

-Line Chart (Monthly Trend): Shows sales trends from January to March.

-Scatter Plot (Quantity vs Total): Explores the relationship between quantity and total sales, segmented by customer type (Member/Normal).

-Pie Chart (Product Line Share): Displays the percentage contribution of each product category to total sales.

Files:

-SupermarketSalesAnalysis.py: with project code

-analyzed_supermarket_sales.csv: Cleaned and analyzed dataset

-plots/: Contains visualizations (city_sales.png, gender_sales.png, monthly_sales.png, quantity_total.png, product_sales_pie.png)

How to Run:

-Install required libraries:pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

-Run SupermarketSalesAnalysis.py in VSCODE.
